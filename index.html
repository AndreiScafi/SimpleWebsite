    <h1>The Red Planet</h1>
    <h2>Exploring the Red Planet: A Look at the Science and History of Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance. It is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and has surface features similar to both the Earth and the Moon.</p>

    <p>Scientists believe that Mars had a much warmer and wetter past, with evidence of liquid water on its surface. This has led to speculation that the planet may have once supported life. In recent years, multiple missions have been launched by NASA and other space agencies to explore Mars and search for signs of past or present life.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant missions to Mars was the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, which sent two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, to the planet in 2004. These rovers were equipped with a variety of scientific instruments and were able to gather valuable data about the planet's geology and history.</p>

    <p>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, also known as the Curiosity rover, was launched in 2011 and is still active on the planet. The rover has been able to provide detailed information about the planet's geology, climate, and potential habitability.</p>
    <p>In addition to these missions, there have been several orbiters sent to Mars to study the planet from above. These include the Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Mars Odyssey.</p>

    <p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the possibility of sending humans to Mars. NASA has announced plans to send astronauts to the planet in the 2030s, and private companies such as SpaceX have also expressed interest in sending humans to Mars.</p>
    <p>Overall, Mars continues to be a fascinating and intriguing planet for scientists and the general public alike. With ongoing missions and future plans for manned </p>
